Download the data.

For predict with current data
1. Extract raw_data.zip to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook files (mutual.ipynb, nav_per_share.ipynb, new_data.ipynb, esg.ipynb) are located.
2. Run mutual.ipynb to generate the mut.csv file.
3. After generating mut.csv, run nav_per_share.ipynb to create the nav_per_share.csv file.
4. Next, run new_data.ipynb to update nav_per_share.csv with the latest data.
5. Before running esg.ipynb, make sure to update the date values in the rows. After updating the dates, execute the code. You should see the model predictions

For data dated 13 December 2023
1. Extract ready_for_esg.zip to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook files (mutual.ipynb, nav_per_share.ipynb, new_data.ipynb, esg.ipynb) are located.
2. Execute the code in esg.ipynb. You should see the model predictions.
